# Beginner Line Follower Robot Using Arduino

This project is a line follower robot built using Arduino Uno, suitable for beginners entering the field of robotics.
The aim is to build and program a robot that follows a black line using IR sensors.

This was created as part of a Line Follower Robot Competition hosted by AUC Robotics in Fall 2024

## Components Used:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Breadboard**
- **Motor Driver**
- **2 DC Motors**
- **3-Way IR Sensor**

## How It Works
The values detected by the IR sensors are used to adjust the robot on the track using forward, right, and left functions.
The correct function is called according to the sensor values
